            I'm a full-time student online at DMACC currently studying to get my
            AAS degree in Computer Information systems. I decided to go back to
            school to further my long-term career goals and am currently
            exploring different fields within computing to see what feels best.
            I also work full-time as a meat cutter at Hy-Vee in Iowa City. I've
            been working for Hy-vee in various roles since 2010. I started
            working in the chinese department in high school where I learned
            that I have a passion for cooking and learning about food. I
            transfered to Italian not long after and worked making pizzas from
            2011 - 2019. I managed the Italian Express department at the
            Waterfront Hy-vee for about 3 years during that time. I also briefly
            ran the BOH for the market grille and would occasionally get to help
            bartend during slower times. Besides cooking I also enjoy mountain
            biking, playing video games, hanging out with my wonderful
            girlfriend, and of course watching Netflix. I have also been
            fortunate enough to get to join my dad on the occasional road trip
            on motorcycles. Summer of 2021 was the most ambitious one yet with a
            trip of over 5000 miles from western Iowa all the way out to
            California, north to Washington, and then back through Yellowstone.

            I'm excited to continue learning about all sorts of wonderful things
            in computing, and I hope to be able to apply the many lessons I've
            learned from working in a diverse range of teams and situations!
