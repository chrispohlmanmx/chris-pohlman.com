        <h1>Caring for your Alaskan Dog</h1>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Build her routine care into your schedule to help your Mal
                    live longer, stay healthier, and be happier during her
                    lifetime. We cannot overemphasize the importance of a proper
                    diet and exercise routine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors
                    closed, pick up after yourself, and block off rooms as
                    necessary. This will keep her out of trouble and away from
                    objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.
                </li>
                <li>Brush her coat as needed, at least weekly.</li>
                <li>
                    Alaskan Malamutes often have serious problems with their
                    teeth, so you’ll need to brush them at least three times a
                    week!
                </li>
                <li>Clean her ears weekly, even as a puppy.</li>
                <li>
                    (S)he's a large dog with lots of energy, so keep her mind
                    and body active, or she'll get bored. That's when the
                    naughty stuff starts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Males are expert diggers and climbers. It is recommended
                    that you bury your fence and that it is at least 6 feet
                    tall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Malamutes can be affected by snow nose, which is a loss of
                    pigment from the nose, making her prone to sunburn. She will
                    need dog-safe sunscreen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give her people
                    food.
                </li>
                <li>Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for her age.</li>
                <li>
                    Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.
                </li>
