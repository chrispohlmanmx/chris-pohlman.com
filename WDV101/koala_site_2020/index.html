        <h2>Welcome to the Koala Bear National Information Center!</h2>

        <p>
            In this site you can learn about Koala bears, adopt a Koala, give to
            our foundation, sign up for our newsletter, or schedule a
            visit. Please take some time to explore the information provided in
            this site!

        <p>
            The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal
            non-profit, non-government organization dedicated to the
            conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its
            habitat.
        </p>

        <p>
            The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown
            from a small group of people interested in researching koala
            disease, to a well-known, global organization with a strong track
            record in strategic koala research, conservation and community
            education with a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
        </p>

        <p>
            Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees
            (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas
            are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are
            actually marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by
            supporting the Koala Bear Information Center.
